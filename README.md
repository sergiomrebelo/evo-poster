# Evolutionary Poster Composer

> ⚠️ 🚧 **Warning:** 
> We are working into a new version of `evo-poster`. 
> This is a work-in-progress repository, no stable version is currently available.

The **[Evolutionary Poster Composer](https://cdv.dei.uc.pt/evoposter/) (`evo-poster`)** is a computational design system
for the automatic generation of poster designs based on a Genetic Algorithm.

`Evo-poster` is designed to enable the autonomous generation of poster design with __exploration__, __automation__,
and __Cancel changes
visualization__ purposes. From a given content (including text and imagery), the purposed system can generate and evolve
poster designs taking into consideration aesthetically and semantics features of the content. The system is also able to
identify the most important parts of content and highlight them on the outputs.

The system computationally emulates the workflow of
traditional [letterpress print houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterpress_printing) in the 19th century, where
typographer (or designers) created posters while trying to fill a matrix, often in collaboration with the client.
