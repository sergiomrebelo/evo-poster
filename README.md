# Evolutionary Poster Composer

The [Evolutionary Poster Composer](https://cdv.dei.uc.pt/evoposter/) (evo-poster) is a computational design system for
the automatic creation of poster designs based on a Genetic Algorithm.

This experiment computationally emulates the workflow of
traditional [letterpress printhouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterpress_printing) in the 19th century. This
working process of these printhouses was slightly different from the typical
contemporary Graphic Design processes. At the time, letterpress designers created posters while trying to fill a matrix,
often in collaboration with the client. The design decisions of these designers were very pragmatic: extensive sentences
were composed in condensed typefaces, and short sentences were composed in extended typefaces. Also, the most important
parts of the content were emphasised using bigger typefaces.
